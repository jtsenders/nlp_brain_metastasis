# nlp_brain_metastasis

This code constitutes the source code used for a project on natural language processing (NLP) in brain metastasis patients. The goal of this project was to develop and compare several NLP approaches for automated classification of radiology reports. The link to the original publication can be found here [insert link]. This code is made publicly available to promote the transparency and reproducibility of computer code used for natural language processing in clinical research. Suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Please contact me for any questions, comments, or suggestions related to the code.

Kind regards,
